## Compile data into single data frame

```{r data compilation}
setwd("~/Documents/Grad School/Thesis/Prairies/Data And Analysis/Climate/GMT/Indices-Monthly")

month_files <- list.files("~/Documents/Grad School/Thesis/Prairies/Data And Analysis/Climate/GMT/Indices-Monthly",full.names = T) 

month_files_name <- list.files("~/Documents/Grad School/Thesis/Prairies/Data And Analysis/Climate/GMT/Indices-Monthly",full.names = F)

indices.monthly = data.frame()

######Read each monthly csv and bind all into one data frame with necessary labels
for(i in 1:length(month_files)){
  data.ind <- read.csv(month_files[i],header = F,skip = 1)
  Month <- rep(substr(month_files_name[i],1,3),times=length(data.ind[,1]))
  index <- rep(substr(month_files_name[i],5,nchar(month_files_name[i])-4),times=length(data.ind[,1]))
  binding = cbind(data.ind,Month,index)
  indices.monthly = rbind(indices.monthly,binding)
    }

Years = 1980:(1980+ncol(indices.monthly)-6)
colnames(indices.monthly) = c("Transect","Lat",'Lon',Years,"Month","Index")  

```

Now let's put this in long form to make analysis easier
```{r monthly long form}
library(data.table)
head(indices.monthly)
indices.monthly.long = data.table(melt(indices.monthly,id=c("Transect","Month","Index"),measure=4:(ncol(indices.monthly)-2)))
head(indices.monthly.long)
class(indices.monthly.long)
index.names = as.character(indices.monthly.long[,unique(Index)])
```

#Visualize the monthly indices 

##Index Key:
FD -Annual count of days when TN (daily minimum temperature) < 0°C  
SU - Annual count of days when TX (daily maximum temperature) > 25°C.  
ID - Annual count of days when TX (daily maximum temperature) < 0 °C.  
TR - Annual count of days when TN (daily minimum temperature) > 20 °C.   
GSL - Growing Season length. Annual* count between the first span of at least 6 days with daily mean temperature TG >5 °C and the first span after July 1st (Jan 1st in SH) of 6 days with TG <5 °C.  
TXx - Monthly maximum value of daily maximum temperature  
TNx - Monthly maximum value of daily minimum temperature  
TXn - Monthly minimum value of daily minimum temperature  
TNn - Monthly minimum value of daily minimum temperature

TN90p - Percentage of days when TN > 90th percentile  
TX90p - Percentage of days when TX > 90th percentile  
WSDI - Warm spell duration index: annual count of days with at least 6 consecutive days when TX > 90th percentile

##Compilation for yearly indices

```{r data compilation 2}
setwd("~/Documents/Grad School/Thesis/Prairies/Data And Analysis/Climate/GMT/Indices-Yearly")

year_files <- list.files("~/Documents/Grad School/Thesis/Prairies/Data And Analysis/Climate/GMT/Indices-Yearly",full.names = T) 

year_files_name <- list.files("~/Documents/Grad School/Thesis/Prairies/Data And Analysis/Climate/GMT/Indices-Yearly",full.names = F)

indices.yearly = data.frame()

######Read each monthly csv and bind all into one data frame with necessary labels
for(i in 1:length(year_files)){
  data.ind <- read.csv(year_files[i],header = F,skip = 1)
  index <- rep(substr(year_files_name[i],1,nchar(year_files_name[i])-4),times=length(data.ind[,1]))
  binding = cbind(data.ind,index)
  indices.yearly = rbind(indices.yearly,binding)
    }

Years = 1980:(1980+ncol(indices.yearly)-5)
colnames(indices.yearly) = c("Transect","Lat",'Lon',Years,"Index")  

```

Now let's put this in long form to make analysis easier
```{r yearly long form}
library(data.table)
head(indices.yearly)
indices.yearly.long = data.table(melt(indices.yearly,id=c("Transect","Index"),measure=4:(ncol(indices.yearly)-2)))
head(indices.yearly.long)
class(indices.yearly.long)
index.names = as.character(indices.yearly.long[,unique(Index)])
```

##Prepping and merging indices

See model indices selection logic for which ones we are using and why. Several of these need to be adjusted, averages, etc. and then all need to be appropriately merged to the cover file.

```{r indices prep}
indices.yearly=as.data.table(indices.yearly.long)
indices.monthly=as.data.table(indices.monthly.long)
setnames(indices.monthly,c("variable", "value","Index"),c("Year","val.mth","Index.m"),skip_absent=TRUE)
setnames(indices.yearly,c("variable", "value","Index"),c("Year","val.yr","Index.y"),skip_absent=TRUE)

#load in cover
#load data
cover=as.data.table(read.csv("/Volumes/GoogleDrive/My Drive/Thesis/Prairies/Data And Analysis/Prairie Analysis/Prairie-Analysis/Cover_data_model.csv",header = T)) 

#Create a new cover file to merge climate data into
cover.climate = cover

transect.master=as.data.table(read.csv("/Volumes/GoogleDrive/My Drive/Thesis/Prairies/Data And Analysis/Prairie Analysis/Prairie-Analysis/Transect_master_V2.csv",header = T)) #use V2 after data issue

z = transect.master[,.(Transect_I,TransectNa)]
setnames(z,c("Transect_I","TransectNa"),c("TransectID","Transect"))
indices.monthly = merge(indices.monthly,z, by = "Transect", all = T)
indices.monthly[,Transect:=NULL]
indices.yearly = merge(indices.yearly,z, by = "Transect", all = T)
indices.yearly[,Transect:=NULL]

indices.monthly$Year = as.integer(as.character(indices.monthly$Year))

###txx

table(txx$Year,txx$Month) #See how max temperatures are divided between months each year. There is a case here for just taking txx for July...but August also has an impact.

#Merge txx with cover
txx[,Month:=NULL]
txx[,Index.m:=NULL]
cover.climate = merge(cover.climate,txx, by=c("Year","TransectID"))
setnames(cover.climate,"val.mth",'txx')

###tn90p
#First sum tn90p values for winter "dormant" months, let's say Decemeber - March
